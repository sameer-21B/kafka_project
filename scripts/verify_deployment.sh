# **CRUCIAL FOR ETL:** Update the execution mechanism if necessary.
# 1. Update Cron Job: (Most common for simple scheduling)
# Assuming your cron entry looks like:
# 0 0 * * * /opt/etl_scripts/my_etl_app/venv/bin/python /opt/etl_scripts/my_etl_app/my_etl_script.py >> /var/log/my_etl.log 2>&1
# You likely don't need to change the cron entry itself unless the path changes.
# If the script name changes, you might need to update the crontab.
# (echo "0 0 * * * /opt/etl_scripts/my_etl_app/venv/bin/python /opt/etl_scripts/my_etl_app/new_etl_script.py" | crontab -)

# 2. AWS Systems Manager State Manager/Run Command:
# If you're using SSM to trigger the script, you just need to ensure the SSM document
# or State Manager association points to the new path. No direct action here.
# The SSM document would reference the absolute path of the script.

# 3. Simple replacement: If your script is just picked up by a watcher or external trigger,
# simply replacing the files is enough.
